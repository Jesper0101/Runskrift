# Runskrifts Projekt

This project explores runestones using machine learning techniques to analyze and classify them, paired with an interactive map that visualizes their geographical locations. The data is integrated into Power BI for dynamic visualizations, including coordinates of runestones, allowing for deep insights into their distribution.


## Features

- üìä Machine Learning Analysis:
    - Classification and clustering of runestones based on features such as age and origin


- üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Map:
    - Visualization of runestone locations on a map with Power BI 
    - Drill down to specific coordinates for detailed information on individual artifacts.

- üìç Runestone Coordinates:
    - Each runestone is linked to its GPS coordinates, enabling researchers and enthusiasts to explore their physical locations.


## How It Works

1. Data Collection:

- The project starts by gathering a dataset of runestones, inscriptions and geographical information (GPS coordinates).

2. Machine Learning:

- Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the textual inscriptions.

- NLP Analysis: Apply machine learning algorithms to classify runestone inscriptions

- Modeling: Use algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to analyze and classify the runestones.

3. Interactive Map:

- Use Power BI to create an interactive dashboard.

## Installation

To set up this project locally:

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jesper0101/Runskrift.git
cd Runskrift
```

2. Machine Learning Model: Run the machine learning analysis:

```bash
V√•ran machine learning model
```


3. Power BI Setup:

- Open the provided Power BI file (Ingen fil just nu).
- Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed. You can download it [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

4. Data Visualization:

- Upload the cleaned dataset into Power BI.
- Use the pre-built dashboard to visualize the runestone locations and coordinate-based insights.
